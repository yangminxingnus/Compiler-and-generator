Handin Directions
=================

Please follow these directions *exactly*.

1. Prepare the files that you want to turn in.  Make a new directory,
   say named "HW", then "cd HW".  

   In this HW directory, include a README file indicating what you
   think works and does not work for your assignment.  In this file,
   explain any peculiarities in your implementation.  In addition,
   also includes part5 as indicated in the handout.

   IMPORTANT: The first line of README should have EACH team member's
   name and student id, e.g.
       
       John Doe, 888888888
       Jane Roe, 999999999
   
   Into this HW directory, copy each of the part.  In your HW
   directory, you will have 4 directories: part1, part2, part3, and 
   part4.

   If your program does not fully work, turn in the last working part
   along with your attempt at the next part, and indicate this clearly
   in the README file.

   Remove files we don't need by:
 
         make clean

         rm t*.e *.correct *.output run run1 runall showdiffs

         rm any other "junk" files you might have there.

      (But, be sure that what you give us is still complete and working
      as well as it did for you!)


2. In the HW directory, type in the command

      zip -r hw2 *

   This will create a file named hw2.zip containing the directories
   part1 ... part4 and the README file. 

3. Submit your hw2.zip file to Canvas.
